# Security Documentation for CSVLint.io

## Overview
This document outlines the security measures implemented in the CSVLint.io application to protect against file injection, abuse, and other security vulnerabilities.

## Security Vulnerabilities Addressed

### 1. File Upload Security
- **File Type Validation**: Implemented server-side validation for uploaded files
- **MIME Type Checking**: Validates both file extension and MIME type
- **File Size Limits**: 10MB maximum file size
- **File Count Limits**: Maximum 2 files per request (CSV + schema)
- **Temporary File Cleanup**: Files are deleted immediately after processing

### 2. URL Validation & SSRF Protection

The application implements comprehensive URL validation to prevent Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks:

#### Blocked Protocols
- `file:` - Prevents access to local files
- `data:` - Prevents data URI attacks
- `javascript:` - Prevents script injection
- `vbscript:` - Prevents VBScript injection

#### Blocked IP Ranges
- `localhost` and `127.0.0.1` - Blocked except for our own server
- `::1` (IPv6 localhost) - Blocked except for our own server
- Private IP ranges: `10.x.x.x`, `172.16-31.x.x`, `192.168.x.x`

#### Allowed Localhost URLs
- URLs pointing to our own server are allowed for internal functionality
- This enables the examples page to work with local example files
- Only URLs matching our server's host and port are permitted

#### CSV File Validation
- **File Extension Check**: URLs must end with `.csv`, `.tsv`, or `.txt`
- **Content Type Validation**: Server responds with appropriate CSV content types
- **Supported Types**: `text/csv`, `application/csv`, `text/tab-separated-values`, `text/plain`
- **Rejection**: Non-CSV files (images, PDFs, scripts, etc.) are rejected

#### Validation Process
1. URL format validation using `validator.isURL()`
2. Protocol validation against dangerous protocols
3. Hostname validation against blocked IP ranges
4. Special handling for localhost URLs pointing to our own server
5. CSV file validation (extension + content type check)

### 3. Input Sanitization
- **XSS Prevention**: All user inputs are escaped using validator.js
- **Parameter Validation**: Query parameters are validated and sanitized
- **MongoDB ID Validation**: Validation report IDs are checked for proper format

### 4. Security Headers
- **Helmet.js**: Comprehensive security headers
- **Content Security Policy**: Restricts resource loading to same origin only
- **External Scripts**: All JavaScript moved to external files to comply with CSP
- **HSTS**: HTTP Strict Transport Security
- **X-Frame-Options**: Prevents clickjacking
- **X-Content-Type-Options**: Prevents MIME type sniffing

### 5. Rate Limiting
- **IP-based Limiting**: 100 requests per 15 minutes per IP
- **Localhost Exemption**: Development requests from localhost and internal IPs are exempt
- **Conditional Limiting**: Internal requests bypass rate limiting
- **Request Logging**: Rate limit violations are logged

### 6. CORS Configuration
- **Origin Restriction**: Configurable allowed origins via environment variable for main application
- **Badge Embedding**: Open CORS for validation endpoints to allow badge embedding on external websites
- **Examples Route**: Dedicated route for serving example files with CORS enabled
- **Credentials Support**: Proper CORS configuration for credentials where needed

## Environment Variables for Security

Add these to your `config.env` file:

```env
# Security Configuration
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://localhost:3080,https://csvlint.io
HASH_SECRET=your_secure_random_secret_key_here
```

## Security Recommendations

### 1. Production Deployment
- Use HTTPS in production
- Set up proper SSL/TLS certificates
- Configure reverse proxy (nginx/Apache) with security headers
- Use environment variables for all sensitive configuration

### 2. Monitoring and Logging
- Implement comprehensive logging for security events
- Monitor for unusual traffic patterns
- Set up alerts for rate limit violations
- Log file upload attempts and validation results

### 3. Additional Security Measures
- Consider implementing API key authentication for high-volume users
- Add request signing for sensitive operations
- Implement file content scanning for malicious content
- Set up automated security scanning

### 4. Database Security
- Use MongoDB authentication
- Restrict database access to application server only
- Regular database backups
- Monitor for unusual database queries

### 5. Network Security
- Use firewall rules to restrict access
- Implement DDoS protection
- Regular security updates for dependencies
- Monitor for suspicious network activity
